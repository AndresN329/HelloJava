# ☕ Introduction to Java

This repository is dedicated to my learning of **Java**, a programming language widely used in the development of enterprise, mobile, desktop, and distributed systems applications.

## 📖 What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language created by *James Gosling* in 1995 and maintained by **Oracle**.
Some of its main features:

- **Portability**: thanks to the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**, Java code can run on multiple platforms without modification.
- **Object-oriented**: everything in Java is organized around classes and objects.
- **Robust and secure**: includes automatic memory management (garbage collector) and strong error-handling mechanisms.
- **Multithreading**: allows the execution of multiple processes concurrently.
- **Large community and libraries**: It has a very large and active ecosystem.

Java's motto is: **“Write once, run anywhere”.**

## 🖥️ First Java program

The classic **"Hello World"** in Java is written like this:

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}
```

### Explanation:
- `public class Main` → defines a public class called `Main`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)` → main method, the entry point for any Java application.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` → prints a message to the console.

## ⚙️ How to compile and run

1. Save the file with the `.java` extension (example: `Main.java`).
2. Compile the file:
```bash
javac Main.java
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
java Main
```

## 🧩 Topics I will study in this repository

- Basic syntax: variables, data types, operators.
- Flow control: conditionals (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
- Exception handling.
- Collections in Java.
- Data input and output (I/O).
- Concurrent programming (multithreading).
- Small practice projects.
